A in A->B is (A'->B'), i.e., the retention of A'->B'.

And A' in A'->B' is (A''->B''), i.e., the retenton of A''->B''.

And the same applies hereafter.

Now we consider the form of the semiosis ((((...)->B''')->B'')->B')->B by identifying all of B, B', B'', B''', ... as b.

We then define a function s(x) of x as s(x) ≡ (x)->b.

We refer the fixed point of s(x) as a.

a satisfies s(a) = a. 

Therefore, it holds that a = (a)->b. And it also holds that a = ((a)->b)->b. And the same applies hereafter.

The fixed point of s(x) is the very form of the nesting structure of semiosis.

We call what makes us identify all of B, B', B'', B''', ... *the form of the signifier*. This corresponds to what Kant has called die *reinen Formen der Anschauung*.

When deriving the fixed point of s(x), we never talk about anything that is not a form. Therefore, what we have derived as the fixed point of s(x), i.e., a given above, must also be a form. This form can be regarded as the unreachable entry point of semiosis. This corresponds to what Kant has called *Freiheit*.

----

The function s(x) is being given direction (donné sens) by retention of x to some coming signifier.
