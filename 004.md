What we as an interpretant should do is not to seek what we can share but to seek what we already share.

The capacity to seek what we as an interpretant already share is called empathy.

Our capacity to recall enables us to seek what we as an interpretant already share.

To seek what we as an interpretant already share is not to do something together. Gathering together derails what we as an interpretant should do. In short we as an interpretant need distance.

For us as a finite interpretant recalling (Erinnerung) is framing (Einbildung). We as a finite interpretant cannot distinguish recalling from framing. ("There is nothing new under the sun.")
