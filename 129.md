Some people compare experience to seeing. We rather compare experience to eating.

The experience of Grenze is an experience that can be described as follows: I can't eat this one.

Semiosis is something through which we feed ourselves.

At the very early stage of semioisis any this-side (citra) eats everything that the this-side itself feeds. Interpretants at such an early stage can be compared to an infant in the mother's womb.

Interpretant is porous. Some of its holes are filled by retention. The holes that are not filled by retention are penetrated (not filled) by the that-side (ultra). The penetration of the unfilled holes produces a signifier (signifiant).

The multiplicity of the holes corresponds to the multidimensionality of semiosis.

The cognitive process of human beings can also be described in this way.
