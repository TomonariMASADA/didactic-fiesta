The current AIs cannot be AGIs. This is because we measure the world in a completely different manner than the current AIs.

For example, we have no fixed pixels for visual sensing and no fixed vocabularies for language processing.

All information processings performerd by the current AIs rely on some set of definit units of information.

In contrast, our information processings rely on a set of units that are updated constantly and flexibly.

We have no fixed set of pixels. We have no fixed set of vocabulary words/subwords/bytes.

The main problem of the current AIs is measurement. We never measure the world as the current AIs do.

By the way, we here talk about indifference. Indifference induces particulars, which are a set of units that are updated constantly and flexibly.
