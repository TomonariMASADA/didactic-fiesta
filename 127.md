The capacity we consider is not simply a capacity to do something. The capacity we consider is a capacity to accept something and give something. In this sense it is similar to function.

However, both those which any capacity accepts and those which any capacity gives are a particular, not an individual. Therefore, we can not say that what a capacity gives when given the same thing is always the same.  In this sense capacity is different from function.

While philosophers sometimes use the notion of function to provide their epistemology, we need to be careful about the sense in which the notion is used. In mathematics any function assigns exactly one thing to each element in the domain.

A capacity can be concatenated to another capacity by accepting something given by it or by giving something to it.

We here provide a theory of semiosis, which is a concatenation of processes.
