The capacity we consider is not simply a capacity to do something. The capacity we consider is a capacity to accept something and give something. In this sense it is similar to function.

However, both those which a capacity accepts and those which a capacity gives are a particular, not an individual. Therefore, we can not say that what a capacity gives when given the same thing is always the same.  In this sense capacity is different from function.

While philosophers sometimes use the notion of function when providing their own epistemology, we need to be careful about the sense in which the notion is used. In mathematics any function assigns exactly one and the same thing to each element in the domain.

A capacity can be concatenated to another capacity by accepting something given by the latter or by giving something to the latter.

We here provide a theory of semiosis.
