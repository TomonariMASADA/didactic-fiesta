Being settled by a particular A to a particular B is written as A -> B.

Being settled by a particular A->B to a particular C is written as (A->B)->C.

What is settled by a particular A->B to a particular C is called interpretant.


The reason why being settled by a particular A->B to a particular C is not written as A->B->C will be given later.


(A->B) in (A->B)->C is called signified.

C in (A->B)->C is called signifier.


A in (A->B) and (A->B) in (A->B)->C have the same form.

A in A->B is in its turn (A'->B') with respect to a particular A' and a particular B'.

Therefore, what is settled by a particular A to a particular B is also an interpretant.


Let me explain with an example.

Looking at the glass I am looking at from one angle from another angle is being settled by a particular A to a particular B.

A particular A in this example is all history before I have come to look at the glass from another angle.

What is settled by a particular A to a particular B in this example is what is looking at the glass. In other words, what is looking at the glass is the interpretant in this example.

An interpretant settled by a particular A to a particular B can further be settled to a particular C. And the interpretant in this case is settled to C not by A->B but by (A->B).

(A->B) is a retention of A->B.

In looking at the glass from another angle, the interpretant is A->B actually.

Retention modifies A->B an interpretant actually is into (A->B), which is an actuality of the interpretant.

In other words, retention modifies an interpretant actually being such and such into a such and such actuality of the interpretant.


An interpretant actually being A->B could not be otherwise. In being settled by a particular A to a particular B, an interpretant is nothing but being settled by a particular A to a particular B. Both what is settled by a particular A to a particular B and being settled by a particular A to a particular B are an interpretant.

In actually being such and such, an interpretant is an event.


-> in A->B is actualization.


Retention is questioning.

If the interpretant actually being A->B does not question A->B, only a flat chain A->B->C->... continues.

A->B->C... contains A->B and B->C. However, (A->B)->C contains A->B but not B->C.


What settles interpretant is signified.

That to which interpretant is settled is signifier.


What we discuss here is called semiosis.
