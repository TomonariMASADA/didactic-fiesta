We often think in the following way. We are a subject that stays identical with itself. Each object we see or hear is that which shows us its various aspects depending on the situations and conditions.

The opposite is true. We are an interpretant that never stays identical and continues to constitute itself as a nesting structure having formal integrity brought about by retention. Each individual is that which stays identical with itself. 

Particulars are a result of our alignment following some experience of Grenze. Therefore, each particular shows us its various aspects depending on the situations and conditions.
