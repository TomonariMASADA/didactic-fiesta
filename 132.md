Your signifiers are denoted as &beta;<sub>0</sub>, &beta;<sub>1</sub>, &beta;<sub>2</sub>, etc.
My signifiers are denoted as B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, etc.

Your retention is denoted with [].
My retention is denoted with ().

Your semiosis is denoted as [[&alpha;<sub>0</sub> -> &beta;<sub>0</sub>] -> &beta;<sub>1</sub>] -> &beta;<sub>2</sub>, etc.
My semiosis is denoted as ((A<sub>0</sub> -> B<sub>0</sub>) -> B<sub>1</sub>) -> B<sub>2</sub>, etc.

Consider my semiosis A<sub>0</sub> -> B<sub>0</sub>. The signifier B<sub>0</sub>, which is a sensible, is generated by an utterance you have made. If I attribute an intention &alpha;<sub>0</sub> to you based on my context A_0 with respect to the sensible B<sub>0</sub>, my retention of the semiosis under consideration is written as (&alpha;<sub>0</sub>|A<sub>0</sub> -> B<sub>0</sub>) not as (A<sub>0</sub> -> B<sub>0</sub>), where the symbol "|" represents the distinction between citra and ultra. The left-hand side of "|" is ultra. The right-hand side of "|" is citra.

If this attribution generates a signifier B<sub>1</sub>, my semiosis extends to (&alpha;<sub>0</sub>|A<sub>0</sub> -> B<sub>0</sub>) -> B<sub>1</sub>. By denoting the retended (&alpha;<sub>0</sub>|A<sub>0</sub> -> B<sub>0</sub>) with an abbreviation A<sub>1</sub>, we rewrite the resulting semiosis as A<sub>1</sub> -> B<sub>1</sub>.

You may attribute an intention to me. This intention is your version of my A<sub>1</sub> and is denoted as A<sub>1</sub>|&alpha;<sub>1</sub>. your retention of the semiosis is written as [A<sub>1</sub>|&alpha;<sub>1</sub> -> &beta;<sub>1</sub>], where &beta;<sub>1</sub> is your version of B<sub>1</sub>.
