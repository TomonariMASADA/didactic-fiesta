Your signifiers are denoted as &beta;_0, &beta;_1, &beta;_2, etc.
My signifiers are denoted as B_0, B_1, B_2, etc.

Your retention is denoted with [].
My retention is denoted with ().

Your semiosis is denoted as [[&alpha;_0 -> &beta;_0] -> &beta;_1] -> &beta;_2, etc.
My semiosis is denoted as ((A_0 -> B_0) -> B_1) -> B_2, etc.

Consider my semiosis A_0 -> B_0. The signifier B_0, which is a sensible, is generated by an utterance you have made. If I attribute an intention &alpha;_0 to you based on my context A_0 with respect to the sensible B_0, my retention of the semiosis under consideration is written as (&alpha;_0|A_0 -> B_0) not as (A_0 -> B_0), where the symbol "|" represents the distinction between citra and ultra. The left-hand side of "|" is ultra. The right-hand side of "|" is citra.
