There is a natural kind that can make a distinction between what is a natural kind and what is not a natural kind. And humankind can make a distinction between what is a natural kind and what is not a natural kind.

Only a subset of the instances of humankind actually make this distinction. Therefore we say humankind _can_ make this distinction. A large part of the instances of humankind do not talk about natural kind.

Is their any natural kind other than humankind that can make this distinction?

If there is no natural kind other than humankind that can make this distinction then every natural kind is a label attached by humankind. The naturalness of humankind as a natural kind leads to generating a label that keeps the distinction between what is a natural kind and what is not a natural kind.
