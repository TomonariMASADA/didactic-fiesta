What Andy Clark calls expectation or prediciton is nearly equal to what what Freud calls das Unbewusste does.

Then what Clark does not discuss is Verdraengung. He always discuss das Unbewusste that works without repression. His prediction describes only one half of das Unbewusste. When he talks about what we unconsciously predict, he talks about das Unbewusste that works with no repression. Note the following:

> Everything that is repressed must remain unconscious, but at the very outset let us state that the repressed does not comprise the whole unconscious.

Clark's theory only talks about one half of what our minds do.
