Interpretant is not a subject but an open bundle of capacities. Each capacity has its own counterpart to interact with.

We cannot in advance enumerate the counterparts with which an interpretant interacts. In this sense interpretant is not a closed but an open bundle of capacities.

Retention gives each interpretant its own integrity as a bundle. Without retention only a flat chain of interactions continues. Without multiplicity of capacities we only have an organic or a functional totality of subject. Interpretant as an open bundle of capacities is neither a flat chain of interactions nor an organic totality where every part is explicit. （cf. デランダ『社会の新たな哲学』21頁）

Each capacity has its own counterpart to interact with. Therefore, any A in A->B cannot predict B alone. That with which a capacity of interpretant interacts makes us say that A settles the interpretant to B and does not make us say that A predicts B for the interpretant.
