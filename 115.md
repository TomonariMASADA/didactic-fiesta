On Sellars's distinction between label and description.

We make a transition from the phase where there is no distinction between label and description to the phase where there is a distinction between label and description by taking advantage of an experience of boundedness.

A space of implications is opened up by going through an experience of boundedness, which brings about the course of a semiosis not simply determined by the circumstanses. For example, suppose that someone say here is a wolf when I say here is a dog. This kind of experience eventually makes me consider the consequences of my utterance. A space of implications is opened up here with respect to what I mean with the expression of "dog."
