What we as interpretants should do is not to seek what we can share but to seek what we already share.

The capacity to seek what we as interpretants already share is called empathy.

Our capacity to recall enables us to seek what we as interpretants already share.

To seek what we as interpretants already share is not to do something together. Gathering together derails what we as interpretants should do. In short, we as interpretants need distance.

Recalling (Erinnerung) is framing (Einbildung) for us. We as bounded interpretants cannot distinguish recalling from framing.
