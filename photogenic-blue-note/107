Gradus can be called gradientã€€now. Gradus is leaning.

When the degree on this side is high, the corresponding leaning is upward. And when the degree on this side is low, the corresponding leaning is downward.

On this side, from where the leaning comes does not matter. On this side, only whether the degree is high or low matters.

We call that from which the leaning comes individual.
