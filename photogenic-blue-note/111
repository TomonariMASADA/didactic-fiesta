Retention modifies A'->B' to (A'->B'). Then the interpretant is setteled by (A'->B') to B. Now we have a semiosis (A'->B')->B.

The -> in the semiosis can be regarded as commitment.

Commitment always brings about something to be retended. In this sense commitment can be regarded as retention turned upside down.

We thus call the -> in the semiosis protention.
