Something subjective takes place only after a separation. 
Perceptual error is one among the separations most familiar to us.

Emitting a particular utterance under a particular circumstance is an example of being settled by a particular A to a particular B. 
In this case a particular B contains not only an emission of a particular utterance but also the effects brought about by the emission. 
Those effects bring the semiosis, whose end point is the particular B, into contact with that side (ultra), which in turn modulates the semiosis.

Retention in （A’->B’）->B makes A’->B’ universal. 
A’->B’ is a particular. But （A’->B’） is a universal. 

（A’->B’） is a universal. 
Therefore, the same interpretant can also be settled by （A’->B’） to C, not to B.

A->B is actually （A’->B’）->B, which is in turn actually （（A''->B''）->B’）->B, etc.

The parentheses in （A’->B’）->B represent the universalization achieved by retention.
