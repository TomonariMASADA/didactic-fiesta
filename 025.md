表現の意味と話し手の意味の区別（三木『話し手の意味の心理性と公共性』第5章の4）は、生物学や心理学で確かめられるべき経験的な区別だとは限らない。論理的な区別として考えることもできるのではないか。

例えば、以下のようにして、である。

On the one hand, there is a distinction between the logical phase where there is no distinction between the meaning of an utterance and
the intended meaning of the speaker of the utterance and the logical phase where there is a distinction between them. On the other hand, there is a distinction between the logical phase where there is no distinction between you and me and the logical phase where there is a distinction between you and me.

How do these two distinctions relate? We can think in this way about speaker's meaning.

Talking about the learning in infancy does not make us avoid the infinite regress regarding the distinction between the meaning of an utterance and
the intended meaning of the speaker of the utterance.

The infinite regress is a logical but not a temporal regress. The fact that my life starts at some point does mean that temporal regress stops at some point but does not mean that logial regress stops at some point.

The logical starting point of the meaning of utterances is the phase where I talk with a mouth that is yours and is also mine. I then proceed to the phase where there is a distinction between my mouth and your mouth. This distinction is brought about by some corresponding experience of boundedness. This transition between the two phases may correspond to that from the phase where there is no distinction between the meaning of an utterance and
the intended meaning of the speaker of the utterance and the phase where there is a distinction between them. 

Howevere, we need more careful discussions.
