Something subjective takes place only after a separation. Perceptual error is one among the separations most familiar to us.


Emitting a particular utterance under a particular circumstance is an example of being settled by a particular A to a particular B. In this case a particular B contains not only an emission of a particular utterance but also the effects brought about by the emission. When settled to a particular B, the semiosis whose end point is the particular B is brought into contact with that side (ultra), which in turn modulates the semiosis.


Retention in （A’->B’）->B makes A’->B’ universal. A’->B’ is a particular. But （A’->B’） is a universal. 

（A’->B’） is a universal. Therefore, the same interpretant can also be settled by （A’->B’） to C, not to B.

A->B is （A’->B’）->B, which is in turn （（A''->B''）->B’）->B, etc.

The parentheses in （A’->B’）->B represent the universalization achieved by retention.
