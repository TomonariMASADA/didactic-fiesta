The experience of boundedness (Grenze) can be modeled as an additional decomposition of the semantic space, where the decomposition is along an axis that is additionaly made explicit in the semantic space.

Here is an example how to model semantic space formally. Each axis of semantic space is modeled as a set of real numbers. Suppose that every experience of boundedness (Grenze) decomposes the corresponding axis at zero based on an indifference that makes nonnegative numbers equivant to each other and also negative numbers equivalent to each other. Then all particulars in this semantic space can be identified as a binary number.

Particulars are on this side (citra). Universals are public.

The antonym of this side (citra) is that side (ultra). The antonym of public is private.

Language is public, never private, and on this side.
