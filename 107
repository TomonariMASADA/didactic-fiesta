Gradus can be called gradient in English. Gradus is leaning.

When the degree on this side (citra) is high, the corresponding leaning is upward. And when the degree on this side is low, the corresponding leaning is downward.

On this side, it does not matter from where the leaning comes. On this side, it only matters whether the degree is high or low. In other words, on this side, it only matters properties (species sensibiles).

We call that from which leaning comes individual.
