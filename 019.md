In A->B, A is f'(x_i) as gradient (gradus), B is x_{i+1} as anchorage, and the interpretant is f(x) as terrain.

A in A->B is itself (A'->B') for some A' and B' but not A'->B'. The parantheses in (A'->B') tell that interpretant is equipped with intentionality, which is a condition of possibility of interpretant's retention.

B in A->B tells that interpretant is partial.

When we say or write something, there is a particular reason for us to do so. -> in A->B tells that there is a particular reason when we say or write something. B is a signifier, i.e., what we say or write. Interpretant is pushed forward from A to B.

Interpretant constitutes itself in this being kept pushed forward.

Before being pushed forward from (A'->B') to B, interpretant modifies A'->B' into (A'->B') by retention. Retention is triggered by intentionality of interpretant. That interpretant is pushed forward to B is that interpretant means something.

By going upstream from B to A in A->B, we make B that which means A. Recall constitutes a relationship from signifier to signified in this way. The signified corresponding to the signifier B is intending A'->B' but not an intended A'->B'.
