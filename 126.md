> Context is always a context for something. (A'->B') in (A'->B')->B is a context. However, the rentended A'->B', i.e., (A'->B'), is not yet a context. Protention makes (A'->B') a context for some B as (A'->B')->B. The second -> in (A'->B')->B represents this protention. Protention following retention makes the retended a context for some anchorage.

As given above, protention following retention makes the retended a context for some anchorage.

Semiosis is a process formed by an indefinite repetition of the following three capacities of interpretant: retention, protention, and anchorage.

These three capacities are repeated in this order.

We denote each of these three capacities as re(), pro(), and an(), respectively.

We call the fixed point x satisfying x = an(pro(re(x))) *Erfahrung*.

We call the fixed point x satisfying x = pro(re(an(x))) *Horizont* or *bestimmte Unbestimmtheit*.

We call the fixed point x satisfying x = re(an(pro(x))) *Sinn*.

If you are a fatalist, you must regard each of these three capacities as a function. What we call fixed point is defined with respect to capacity, not to function.
