I say that this is a person, i.e., P(a), while I hear that you say that this is not a person, i.e., Â¬P(a). Here I have an experience of Grenze. (I don't know if you also have an experience of Grenze yet.)

The particular denoted as this is an instance of the universal of person for me. However, this is not the case for you.

(By saying that we only discard the law of excluded middle here not the law of noncontradiction, can we provide a relief for the people living in the world of formal logic?)

The particular denoted as this makes us perform an alignment with respect to the universal of person.
