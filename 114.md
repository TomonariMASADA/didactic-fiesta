I say that this is white, i.e., W(a), while I hear that you say that this is not white, i.e., Â¬W(a). Here I have an experience of Grenze. (I don't know if you also have an experience of Grenze yet.)

The particular denoted as this is an instance of the universal of white for me. However, this is not the case for you.

(By saying that we only discard the law of excluded middle here not the law of noncontradiction, can we provide a relief for the people living in the world of formal logic?)

The particular denoted as this can make me perform an alignment with respect to the universal of white.

The particular denoted as this can make me perform an alignment that modifies the indifference making the particular called into question now equivalent to the other white particulars. The alignment can make particulars other than that called into question now non-member of the universal of person.

Before this experience of Grenze, the particular called into question is an instance of the universal of white for me. After this experience of Grenze, it can still be an instance of the universal of white.

When I align my judgment with yours, the particular called into question shows its bareness, because the particular is called into question in the court of instance where it loses the very property I am interested in.

In other words, we meet no bare particulars in the ordinary course of semiosis.
