I say that this is white, i.e., W(a), while I hear that you say that this is not white, i.e., Â¬W(a). Here I have an experience of Grenze. (I don't know if you also have an experience of Grenze yet.)

The particular denoted as this is an instance of the universal of white for me. However, this is not the case for you.

(By saying that we only discard the law of excluded middle here not the law of noncontradiction, can we provide a relief for the people living in the world of formal logic?)

The particular denoted as this can make me perform an alignment with respect to the universal of white.

The particular denoted as this can make me perform an alignment that modifies the indifference making the particular called into question now equivalent to the other white particulars. The alignment can make particulars other than that called into question now non-member of the universal of person.
