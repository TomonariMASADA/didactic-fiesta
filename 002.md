In A->B, A is f'(x) as gradient (gradus), B is x as anchorage, and the interpretant is f(x) as terrain.

The interpretant is settled by a particular f'(x) to a particular x and is never settled by a particular x to a particular f'(x). However, the interpretant recalls (erinnert) f'(x) from x.


Settlement (Bestimmung) is not recalling (Erinnerung).


Of course, retention (Retention) is not recalling (Erinnerung).


In A->B the interpretant can only recall A and cannot experience A.
