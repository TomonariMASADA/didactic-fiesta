In [21](021.md), we have obtained the nesting structure of semiosis as a fixed point of s(x) â‰¡ (x)->b, where b stands for the identification of B, B', B'', B''', ... We have reached this identification owing to the *reinen Formen der Anschauung*.

Here let us recall the notion of Kontinuum from the later Brentano.

What we experience is continuous. Our experience is continual.

What we retend is continuous. The nesting structure of semiosis is continual.

What we experience and what we retend are both continuous. However, the unreachable entry point of the nesting structure of semiosis is on this side, and what we experience spreads over both of this side (citra) and that side (ultra).

The Kant's distinction phenomena/noumena corresponds to the distinction continual/continuous given above.
