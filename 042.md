Semiosis is not a process where a point is moving to form a line. Semiosis is also not a bundle of multiple lines.

Semiosis is always accompanied by many indifferences, each of which is an indistinguishability along a specific dimension.

A specific dimension is made explicit by an experience of Grenze as a direction perpendicular to the Grenze.

Therefore, semiosis is a process whose multidimensionality is unfolded one by one every time an experience of Grenze makes explicit a dimension perpendicular to the Grenze.
